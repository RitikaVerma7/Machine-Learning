# My Machine Learning and Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository, a documentation of my journey through the realms of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). This journey began with a deep dive into a Deep Learning course I am currently pursuing, followed by an intensive Machine Learning course. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, explorations, and insights gained along the way.

## Journey Overview

My exploration into ML and DL is motivated by a strong desire to understand and apply advanced algorithms to solve real-world problems. This repository serves as a testament to this ongoing journey, showcasing:

- **Major Project: Skincare Recommendation System:** A comprehensive project aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict skincare product recommendations based on customer reviews and product features.

- **Supervised Learning Exploration:** Dive into core concepts like logistic regression, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods. Each concept is explored through dedicated mini-projects and exercises, highlighting their applications and effectiveness.

- **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:** An exploration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reducing the dimensionality of datasets, enhancing model performance, and visualization.

- **Unsupervised Learning:** Investigating clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN to uncover hidden patterns and groupings in data without labeled responses.

- **Sequential Neural Network:** Implementing sequential neural networks to tackle more complex problems, understanding the architecture, and optimizing network performance.

- **Working with Text Data:** Explorations into natural language processing (NLP) techniques like Bag of Words, lemmatization, normalization, and vectorization to process and analyze text data efficiently.

## Deep Learning Coursework

The deep learning course laid the foundation for understanding complex neural network architectures, backpropagation, and optimization algorithms. Projects and exercises from this course are included to demonstrate the application of theory to practical problems.

## Machine Learning Coursework

The ML course provided a comprehensive overview of various learning algorithms, evaluation metrics, and real-world applications. This section includes notes, homework, and projects focused on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Highlights and Learning Outcomes
